# Node.js Server Inactivity Hang

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Node.js HTTP server stops responding to requests after a period of inactivity.  The server appears to hang and requires a restart to resume functionality.

## Bug Description

A seemingly simple HTTP server created using `http.createServer` stops responding to incoming requests after some time of inactivity.  No errors are thrown, and the server processes do not appear to crash, but they fail to respond to any further requests.

## Solution

The issue is likely related to the event loop becoming blocked or starved of resources. In this case, ensure that all listeners to events such as sockets and connections are cleaned up properly when these connections end. Failure to do so results in the server holding onto many open sockets causing the server to no longer be able to respond to requests.  The solution might involve implementing more robust error handling and resource cleanup (like closing connections).
